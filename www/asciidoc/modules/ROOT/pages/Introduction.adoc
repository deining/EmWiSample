== Sample application

In the course of this tutorial, we are going to develop a small GUI application for execution inside a web browser. A screenshot of a browser window running the application is shown in <<fig:TutorialApp>> below:

The tutorial application comprises two components, titled _Bell_ and _Weather report_. When pressing the push-button of the _bell_ component, a beep will sound. When pressing the push-button of the _weather report_ component, you will be redirected to a web site showing a weather report. The application is localized, by clicking on a flag icon in the upper right corner you can select either _English_ or German as language of the user interface. The chosen language setting will be stored inside the local storage of your web browser and will be remembered when on the next startup, even when exit and restart your browser.
