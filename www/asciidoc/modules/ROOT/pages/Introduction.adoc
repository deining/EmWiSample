== About Embedded Wizard

https://www.embedded-wizard.de/[Embedded Wizard^] is a graphical user interface tool developed and distributed by https://www.tara-systems.de/[TARA Systems GmbH] for creating graphical user interface (GUI) applications mainly for embedded systems.

== Motivation for this tutorial

At work, we used Embedded Wizard GUI builder intensively in a development project. While the Embedded Wizard software proved to be an extremely powerful tool, getting started with this tool was quite challenging for me:

* Embedded Wizard strictly follows and implements an object oriented programming approach. These concepts may not be immediately obvious to a novice user however, who may be overwhelmed by terminology of properties, outlets, and so on.
* Device integration will an essential part of every real world project, this is where many newbies are often struggling. The situation is worsened by the fact that Embedded Wizards supports dozens of target devices, each one being different, which makes it hard to provide universal instructions here.
* Excellent Documentation with many small samples, not connected, so it remains a challenge to get a big picture how to design your application properly.

== Target audience, prior knowledge

The main audience for the book are professional developers that want to ...

== Scope of the tutorial

This project aims at providing a tutorial for potential users of Embedded Wizard to get them started quickly.

While building a sample application step by step, the tutorial covers the following topics:

* https://deining.github.io/EmWiTutorial/EmWiTutorial/latest/ComponentReusability.html[Developing and prototyping reusable graphical components]
* https://deining.github.io/EmWiTutorial/EmWiTutorial/latest/DeviceIntegrationBrowser.html[Device integration]
* https://deining.github.io/EmWiTutorial/EmWiTutorial/latest/LocalizingYourApplication.html[Localization of your application]
* Persistent data storage on the target device

== Sample application

In the course of this tutorial, we are going to develop a small GUI application for execution inside a web browser. A screenshot of a browser window running the application is shown in <<fig:TutorialApp>> below:

The tutorial application comprises two components, titled _Bell_ and _Weather report_. When pressing the push-button of the _bell_ component, a beep will sound. When pressing the push-button of the _weather report_ component, you will be redirected to a web site showing a weather report. The application is localized, by clicking on a flag icon in the upper right corner you can select either _English_ or German as language of the user interface. The chosen language setting will be stored inside the local storage of your web browser and will be remembered when on the next startup, even when exit and restart your browser.

== Prerequisites

Download and install https://www.embedded-wizard.de/download/[Embedded Wizard Free Edition], version 9.10. The free version has all features of the Professional version, is is restricted to small projects however. Luckily, the free version allows to developing and run the tutorial application without limitation.
