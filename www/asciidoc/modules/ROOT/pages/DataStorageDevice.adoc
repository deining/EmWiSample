= Permanently storing your language setting
Andreas Deininger andreas@deininger.net

In the xref::LanguageSwitcher.adoc[last chapter], we added a language switcher to our tutorial application, allowing you to switch to the desired language. While that's great, any reasonable program will store your language setting so that you have to select the language only once at the very first use of the program. In the next lesson, we will implement this behavior for our application, too. Once we are finished, our browser application will store your language setting in its local storage and will recall these setting on each startup.

== Preparing data storage on the device

* From the gallery templates window (kbd:[Alt+1]) with folder _**C**hora_ opened (key kbd:[C]), drag an instance of the image:icons/AnnotationGroupIcon.png[annotation group icon] _Annotation Group_ to the component's canvas. Place the element on the canvas and rename the property _Caption_ of the element to _Device interface_ using the inspector window. Resize the note group so that it will cover the two existing elements on the canvas. Move the two elements _DeviceClass_ and _Device_ down so that they don't hide the caption any more.
* Drag another instance of the image:icons/AnnotationGroupIcon.png[annotation group icon] _Annotation Group_ to the component's canvas. Place the element underneath the previously inserted note group and rename the property _Caption_ of the newly inserted element to _Enumerations_ using the inspector window.
* From the gallery templates window to the left (kbd:[Alt+1]), drag the element image:icons/EnumIcon.png[enum icon] _Enum_ inside the _Chora_ folder over to the canvas and place it inside the recently inserted note group _Enumerations_. Rename the enumeration to _Language_.
* Double click on the newly inserted enumeration:icons/EnumIcon.png[enum icon]. Inside the composer window, a new tab _Device::Language_ appears which shows the three items of the enumeration.
