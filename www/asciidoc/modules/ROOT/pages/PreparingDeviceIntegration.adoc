= Device integration: Hello world from our device
Andreas Deininger andreas@deininger.net

In the xref::ComponentReusability.adoc[last chapter], we made our component truly reusable by adding properties to it. Afterwards we completed our GUI which now contains two units, one for ringing a bell and another for showing the weather forecast. Unfortunately, there's no real function behind the push buttons of both units yet. We will address this in the following chapter.

== GUI builder and platform packages

Embedded wizard is a GUI framework builder that allows you to build GUI platform independent applications that can deployed on many different target systems. This is achieved by using the programming language Chora for all programming tasks related to the GUI. Other than that, Embedded Wizards strictly refrains from any access to the underlying device to ensure platform independence. However, when building embedded devices, the main purpose of the GUI application is to enable and facilitate interaction with the underlying hardware. So how does Embedded Wizard integrate with those devices? That's where the concept of https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/platform-package[platform packages^] comes into play. Embedded Wizard offers platform packages for many different hardware platforms (STM, NXP, TI, Raspberry Pi, ...). A platform package consists of a code generator, a resource converter, a graphics engine and a runtime environment for the specific platform. You may think of the platform package as a link between the GUI and the hardware. Applications implemented in the programming language Chora can be run on any particular platform if a platform package exists for that platform.

== Adapting the project structure

As explained above, there is a strict separation between the GUI application and the device, represented by one or more platform packages. Let's start and reflect that separation in our application structure, too:

* Click on the image:icons/EmbeddedWizardIcon.png[project icon] _Project_ tab (the first tab from the left).
* Identify the note frame that holds the icon image:icons/ApplicationUnitIcon.png[Icon application unit] that represents the application unit. Rename the heading text of this frame from _Project Units_ to _GUI project_. To do so, change the property _Caption_ of the note frame using the inspector window.
* From the gallery templates window to the left, drag an element image:icons/AnnotationGroupIcon.png[annotation group icon] _Annotation Group_ over to root canvas. Rename the group to _Middleware_.
* Drag an element image:icons/UnitIcon.png[annotation group icon] _Unit_ over to root canvas, add the new unit inside the note rectangle you inserted in the previous step. Rename the unit to _Device_.
* Drag another image:icons/UnitIcon.png[annotation group icon] _Unit_ into the same note rectangle _Middleware_. Rename the unit to _BrowserDevice_.
* Drag a third image:icons/UnitIcon.png[annotation group icon] _Unit_ into the note rectangle _Middleware_. Rename the unit to _TargetDevice_.

The structure of your project should now look as shown in <<fig:ExtendedProjectLayout>> below:

[[fig:ExtendedProjectLayout]]
.Extended project layout
image::deviceintegration/ProjectStructure.png[project layout]

== Adding a interface device class

Let's add content to the newly inserted units! We start with adding a device class interface first:

* Double click on the icon image:icons/DeviceUnitIcon.png[Icon device unit], representing the _Device_ unit. This will open the unit in a new tab.
* In the gallery templates window left to the main composer window, click on the item _Device_, which will open and show all the _device_ subitems.
* Click on the item image:icons/DeviceInterfaceIcon.png[Device interface icon] _Device interface_, and drag an instance over to the component's canvas. Place the element in the upper left corner of the canvas.

By dragging over the _device interface_ to the canvas, two new objects were inserted:

* the _DeviceClass_ element to the left, which represents the class where we will store device related class members like commands, properties and so on, and
* the _Device_ autoobject element associated to the _DeviceClass_ element. This autoobject represents the globally available instance of the device class. This autoobject represents Embedded Wizard's implementation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern[singleton pattern] (if you are familiar with Java, you may think of the _Device_ class as a static class). Using the _Device_ autoobject, any GUI element has direct access to the device class and its members, which is very handy. We will use this autoobject soon.

Your screen should now look like illustrated in <<fig:DeviceClassInterface>> below:

[[fig:DeviceClassInterface]]
.Device class interface
image::DeviceIntegration/DeviceClassInterface.png[device class interface]

Let's go ahead and review and adapt the members of the newly inserted device class interface:

* Double click on the icon image:icons/DeviceAutoObjectIcon.png[Icon autoobject], representing the _Device_ autoobject. This will open the _Device_ class in a new tab. You will see that the canvas was prepopulated with several class members already.
* Identify the note group that holds the icon image:icons/CommandMethodIcon.png[Command method icon] representing the _Command_ method and rename the caption of this note group from _Example of an interface to perform an operation in the device_ to _Command(s)_.
* Rename icon image:icons/CommandMethodIcon.png[Command method icon] representing the _Command_ method to _RingTheBellCommand_.
* Double click on the renamed command. In the code editor window, you will see the method's signature, followed by many lines of template Chora code.
* Have a look at the method signature of the _RingTheBell_ command.

Device commands are represented by regular methods. Like in all programming languages, a method can take parameters and can have a return value. Have a look at the signature of the _RingTheBellCommand_ method shown at the top of the code editor:

[source,chora]
----
 method int32 Device::DeviceClass.RingTheBellCommand( arg int32 aParameter1, arg bool aParameter2)
----

As you can see the method currently takes an int32 value as first argument and a boolean value as second argument. Also, the method returns an int32 value. These settings are not what we want, our simple _RingTheBellCommand_ method does not need any parameters and won't return anything, so the return type should be _void_. Let's go ahead and adjust the method's signature to our needs:

* In the top title line of the code editor containing the method signature, you can see a small downwards triangle. Click on this triangle to show a frame where the method's return value and parameters are listed in separate lines.
* Right click on the first method parameter _arg int32 aParameter1_ to invoke the context menu on this parameter. From this menu select the menu item _Delete_ to remove the first parameter.
* Right click on the remaining method parameter _arg bool aParameter2_. From the context menu shown, select _Delete_ to remove this parameter, too.
* Right click on the first line that shows the method's name _method int32 RingTheBellCommand_. From the context menu shown, select _Edit_ and change the return parameter from _int32_ to _void_.

[[fig:DeleteMethodsParameter]]
.Delete methods parameters
image::deviceintegration/DeleteMethodParameters.png[delete methods parameters]

Once we adjusted the signature of the method, let us adjust the body of the method, too. Remove all template code and put in one single line:

[source,chora]
----
trace "The device class of the GUI is an interface only and cannot run any device commands! Please implement the command in a variant class!";
----

As said, Embedded Wizard does not have access to the underlying device and therefore cannot advise the device to say _Hello_ to us. We have to implement this in a derived class, we will do so shortly.

Since we have set up a device and a command now, let's use it and wire the push button action of the bell to that newly created command:

* Bring up the contents of the main application inside the tab _Application::TutorialApplication_.
* Double click on the icon image:icons/RingTheBellSlotIcon.png[slot icon] representing the slot method _RingTheBellSlot_. Inside the code editor, you will see the line ``trace "Sorry, the GUI cannot ring the bell!";``.

Change this code to

[source,chora]
----
Device::Device.RingTheBellCommand();
----

NOTE: Embedded wizard code editor ships with integrated code completion, which is very handy and might prevent you from typos when authoring code inside the code editor. To test it out, simply write _Device::_ into the editor and should see a list of available completions to the given _Device_ unit name you just typed in.

That's how we call a method by code: specify the class name (_Device::DeviceClass_) first, then append the method name (_RingTheBellCommand_), prepended with a dot and terminated with empty parentheses.
Now run your code using the prototyper, and you should see a trace message informing you that the GUI cannot run any device commands. Obviously, we are not at the end, so read on!

== Adding another profile

As already explained above, there is a strict separation between the GUI application and the device, represented by one or more platform packages. Two platform packages are included in the Embedded Wizard installer and are available out of the box:

* the _Tara.Win32.xxx_ platform package. This is the default platform package that allows you to run the application on your Windows platform. You were using it already when you launched the prototyper to run your application or component (_xxx_ stand for one of the available color formats, either Index8 or RGBxxxxx).
* the _Tara.WebGL.RGBA8888_ platform. This WebGL/Javascript platform package allows you to run the GUI in any WebGL enabled browser. That's especially handy for this tutorial since you don't need any hardware to follow the instruction given.

NOTE: Besides the Win32 and the WebGL packages there are many platform packages available to target real hardware (STM, NXP, TI, Raspberry Pi, ...). For each of these platform packages, a separate installer exists. You have to obtain and run this installer to make the associated platform packages available inside Embedded Wizard.

If we want to make use of more than one platform package inside our project, we have to have an associated *profile* on the Projects tab for each package you would like to use. So let's add another profile that allows us to switch between the Win32 package and the WebGL package. We then use the latter package to output _Hello, world!_ on the browser device, more specifically on the web console of the browser. The journey goes on ... 

* Click on the image:icons/EmbeddedWizardIcon.png[project icon] _Project_ tab (the first tab from the left).
* Identify the note frame with the caption _Profile configuration_, it only contains the icon image:icons/DefaultProfileIcon.png[Default profile icon] representing the default profile. Select this profile and have a look at the inspector window. You will realize that the attribute _PlatformPackage_ of the profile has the value _Tara.Win32.RGBA8888_ assigned. To reflect this, rename the profile from _Profile_ to _Win32_ using the kbd:[F2] key.
* From the gallery templates window to the left, drag the element image:icons/ProfileIcon.png[profile icon] _Profile_ over to the canvas and place it underneath the existing profile _Win32_ . Rename the profile to _Browser_. Resize the note frame and rearrange the elements on the canvas so that the layout looks nice again.
* Our new profile should be associated with the WebGL platform package, so inside the inspector window, change the value of the attribute _PlatformPackage_ from _Tara.Win32.RGBA8888_ to _Tara.WebGL.RGBA8888_.
* Inside the inspector window, change the value of the attribute _ScreenSize_ to _<480,320>_.
* Also change the value of the attribute _OutputDirectory_ to _../WebGL_. This defines the directory where all the code for our website will be stored once we build the project.
* Optionally, you may fill the attributes _ApplicationName_ and _ApplicationTitle_ with the values _TutorialApplication_ or _"Embedded Wizard sample application"_, respectively. For the last value, don't forget the surrounding double quotes here or you may run in trouble.

The _Profile_ section of your project should now look as shown in <<fig:ProjectProfiles>> below:

[[fig:ProjectProfiles]]
.Project profiles and their attributes
image::deviceintegration/ProjectProfiles.png[Project profiles]

[TIP]
====
Now that we have two profiles defined, we can switch between these two profiles using the _Profile_ dropdown list located in the second row of the toolbar, placed right beneath the icon image:icons/BuildProfileIcon.png[Build profile] for building the selected profile and the icon image:icons/BuildBatchIcon.png[Build batch mode] for building multiple profiles in batch mode:

[[fig:DropdownList]]

== Adding a browser device class variant

We already added an interface device class to our project. However, this interface device class is not meant to run any command on the device. The actual execution of the command on the device will happen inside a https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/class-variant-member[class variant]. https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/managing-project-variants[Variants] are an extremly powerful concept of Embedded wizard, in the example below we use it to manage code execution on different platform packages. Variants are useful in various other scenarios, you may use them to manage variants of your application for different screen resolutions or if you want to implement a different look and feel for one or more application components. Let's go ahead and add and populate a class variant for the use with browser devices:

* Click on the image:icons/EmbeddedWizardIcon.png[project icon] _Project_ tab (the first tab from the left).
* Identify the note frame with the caption _Middleware_ which holds three device units, the _Device_ unit, the _BrowserDevice_ unit and the _TargetDevice_ unit.
* Double click on the icon image:icons/BrowserDeviceUnitIcon.png[Icon browser device unit], representing the _BrowserDevice_ unit. This will open the empty unit inside a new tab.
* In the gallery templates window, left to the main composer window, make sure that the tab _Browser_ at the top of the window is selected.
* In the search field immediately below the two tabs, type in _Device_ to shorten the class list.
* Right click on the image:icons/ClassIcon.png[class icon] _Device::DeviceClass_ class to invoke the context menu on this class. From this menu select the menu item _Copy_ to copy the class to the clipboard.
* Right click on the empty canvas in the main window to invoke a context menu. From this menu select the menu item _Variant paste_ to insert a class variant of the device class. Alternatively, you may select the element and drag it over to the canvas while keeping kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+Alt] pressed. Note the letter _V_ in the icon image:icons/VariantClassIcon.png[variant clas icon] of the newly inserted class which marks the class as a class variant.
* Rename the newly inserted variant class to _DeviceClassBrowser_ using the kbd:[F2] key.
* In the inspector window, locate the attribute line _VariantCond_. The right hand  _value_ cell of this attribute line helds a small downwards triangle at the right hand side. Click on this triangle to open the dropdown list populated with all profiles of your project. Deselect all profiles except for the profile _Browser_ and click on the lower button labelled with a checkmark to confirm your choice. With this setting in place, the class variant is now associated with the _Browser_ profile only.

Your screen should now look as shown in <<fig:ClassVariant>> below:

[[fig:ClassVariant]]
.Browser device class variant
image::deviceintegration/DeviceClassBrowser.png[class variant, 1024]

== Implementing a different behaviour for the browser device class variant

We want to make the newly created class behave differently, so there's still some work to do:

* Double click on the icon image:icons/DeviceClassBrowserIcon.png[Icon device class browser], representing the recently add device class variant. This will open the empty _DeviceClassBrowser_ class variant inside a new tab.
* From the gallery templates window to the left, drag an element image:icons/AnnotationGroupIcon.png[annotation group icon] _Annotation Group_ over to root canvas. Rename the group to _Command(s)_.

Have a look at the inspector window and you will see the method _RingTheBellCommand_. This is the command we previoulsy added to the _Device_ class. Since the variant class is derived from this class, it has access to all its class members, including the _RingTheBellCommand_. The light grey colour of the method name marks the method as inherited. We now want to implement a different behaviour for this command in the variant class, we can do so by overriding the method in the variant class:

* In the inspector window, right click on the method _RingTheBellCommand_ to invoke the context menu on the method. From this menu select the menu item _Override class member_. A method element with the same name _RingTheBellCommand_ will appear on the canvas. 
* We are now able to specify different code in the method body of the newly created method: double click on the icon image:icons/RingTheBellSlotIcon.png[slot icon] representing the newly inserted method _RingTheBellCommand_. Inside the code editor, you will see the line ``// TO DO: Write your code here ... ``. That's great, we can add our custom code here which will be executed only once the browser device class variant was called!

Using the code editor, add the following code inside the method body:

[source,chora]
----
trace "Command on browser device was called";

$if (!$prototyper)
  native
  {
    // Javascript code executed inside the browser
    console.log("Hello, world!");
    console.log("We will be able to ring the bell shortly");
  }
$endif
----

Eventually, we are revealing how Embedded Wizard can https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/integrating-with-the-device#1[execute native code] on the device: by making use of the _https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/native-statement[native]_ statement of the Chora language. Any code inside this statement remains untouched and is passed _as is_ to the device. Since we are communicating with browser devices, we have to put JavaScript code inside the _native_ statement. More specifically, we make use of the ``console.log()`` method which outputs arbitrary text to the browser's console.

NOTE: The construct ``$if (!$prototyper) ... $endif`` around the _native_ statement prevents the native code block from being executed once we are using the prototyper for previewing our components or our applications. By adding this statement, we prevent Embedded Wizard from raising a warning that native code will the ignored during prototyping.

== Running the application inside a web browser

Hooray, we are now ready to run the application inside a web browser of your choice! To do, so, we have to build the browser specific code first:

* Switch to the _Browser_ profile using the dropdown list depicted in <<fig:DropdownList>> above.
* Click on the the icon image:icons/BuildProfileIcon.png[Build profile] for building the application for the selected _Browser_ profile. The generated code will be written into the output directory _WebGL_ on the root appliction level. We specified this output directory when creating the _Browser_ profile.
* Loate the output directory on your local file system. We contents of this directory should look like as depicted in <<fig:WebGLFolder>>.

[[fig:WebGLFolder]]
.Contents of WebGL output folder
image::deviceintegration/OutputFolderWebGL.png[output folder WebGL]

* Double click on the file _TutorialApplication.html_ inside your _WebGL_ output directory. This will open your default web browser with a window that runs your application:

[[fig:ApplicationBrowser]]
.executing the application inside a web browser
image::deviceintegration/ApplicationRunBrowser.png[application inside browser]

IMPORTANT: Due to security concerns, the _Chrome_ browser does not allow to load webites locally. We do *not* recommend the use of this browser for local preview of our application since most likely, you are running into trouble.

* Open the Javascript console of your browser. The way how to achieve that depends on your browser:
** Firefox: From the menu, select menu:Tools[Web developer >  Browser console] or use the keyboard shortcut kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+J]
** Microsoft Edge: Use the keyboard shortcut kbd:[F12] to open the Developer Tools, then click on the _Console_ tab or press kbd:[Ctrl+2] to invoke that tab.
* Inside the application in your browser window, click on the push button labelled _Ring_. From your browser console, you should be greeted with _Hello, world!_:

[[fig:BrowserConsole]]
._Hello, world!_ on the browser console
image::deviceintegration/BrowserConsole.png[browser console]

== Finalizing device actions

In order to get results quickly, we made use of the ``console.log()`` inside the _RingTheBell_ command. But we certainly can do better here, let's move on and let the bell ring!
