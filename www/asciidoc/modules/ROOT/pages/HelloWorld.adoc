= Getting started with 'Hello world'
Andreas Deininger andreas@deininger.net

For every language, its a good practice to start by printing out _Hello World!_. So let's start and do this with Embedded Wizard, too!

== Setting up a new project

. Start up Embedded Wizard Studio

. From the main menu, select menu:Project[New ...] to start a new project

. A popup appears:

* In the template, select the item btn:[Empty project].
* Specify _EmWiTutorial_ as project name.
* For the _Location_ of your project, specify a folder of your choice on your local file system.

. Once project name and location are set, press the button btn:[Create new project] to bring up the new project.

== Structure of the project

Let's have a look at the structure of the newly created project. As you can see from <<fig:ProjectLayout>>, in total 4 items were added to the main area, the so called https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/composer-window[composer window^]:

[[fig:ProjectLayout]]

These 4 groups serve totally different purposes:

Mosaic Framework:: This is embedded wizard's GUI framework used under the hood. You shouldn't be concerned about this right now.
Profile configuration:: A profile is used to store configuration parameters for your project. By using different profiles, you can customize the project settings to the different target(s) that you ant to use.
Languages:: The concept of languages is deeply embedded into the system's language _Chora_. If you want to create a multi-lingual app, you can do so by simply adding more languages here.
Project units:: That's the most interesting part for now, so let's start explaining the concept behind:

=== Units

https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/unit-member[Units^] are a way to structure your project. For now, we will deal with one unit only, the _Application_ unit. While we use this unit for now, we will add more units later on. Units are a kind of container for our components used, so have a look now what's inside the _Application_ unit_:

. Double click on the icon image:icons/ApplicationUnitIcon.png[Icon application unit], representing the _Application_ unit.
. Inside the composer window, a second tab appears which shows the contents inside the unit which is now opened.

The unit contains one single element only, the _Application_ class:

.Application unit with application class inside

=== Application class

The _Application_ class is the root element, standing at the very top our application. Again let's see what's inside the _Application_ class, which is a kind of container for the elements of the class:

. Double click on the icon image:icons/ApplicationClassIcon.png[Icon application class], representing the _Application_ class.
. Inside the composer window, a third tab appears which shows the contents of the class which is now opened:

.Application class with root canvas inside
image::helloworld/ApplicationClass.png[Application class]

All you will see here is the transparent root canvas, surrounded by a blue border.
That's not much, so let's put some text on the canvas:

* In the https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/gallery-templates-window[gallery templates window^], left to the main composer window, make sure that the tab _Templates_ is selected.
* In the main area of the templates window, you will find several text item entries. Click on the item _Views_, which will open and show all the _view_-subitems (the items of the templates window follows are arranged in an accordion style layout).
* Identify the item image:icons/TextViewIcon.png[text view icon] Text, representing a simple text view. Click on the element, drag it over to the root canvas and place it in the middle of the canvas.
* If all went fine, you will see a tiny white text element labelled _Text_ in the middle of the canvas.

.Root canvas with inserted text view

So far so good, let's style our text a bit to make it more appealing:

* In the composer window, click on the newly inserted text view to select the element.
* Now have a look at the https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/inspector-window[inspector window^] right to the main composer window: in the upper _member area_ you should see the element named _Text_ selected. Also note the attributes and properties area below that shows all properties of the currently selected text view.
* Inside the attributes and properties area, we can adapt the newly inserted text view to our needs:
** Using the dropdown list, alter the _Font_ property of the text element to the value _Resources::FontExtraLarge_.
** Using the dropdown element, alter the _Color_ property of the text element to the value _#000000FF_ (black, opaque).
** In order to change the display text, alter the _String_ property of the text element to the value _"Hello, world!"_.
** Since we do have text overflow in the element now, alter the _AutoSize_ property of the text element to the value _true_.

That's it, we do have our message on the screen now!

IMPORTANT: When typing in the _Hello, world!_ text, make sure that the string you typed in is surrounded by double quotes, otherwise an error message will come up.

=== Running the application

Our _Hello world_ application is now ready to run!

There are several ways to launch the app:

* From the main menu, select the menu item menu:Build[Start prototyper with application class], or
* use the keystroke combination kbd:[Ctrl+F5], or
* click on the application launch icon image:icons/LaunchApplicationIcon.png[Launch icon] in the second row of the toolbar.

Congratulations, you successfully assembled your first application!
